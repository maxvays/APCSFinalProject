# APCSFinalProject
Final Project for APCS Fall 2018 Semester

Terminal based 2 player checkers.



Development Log

1/6: Initialize classes Board and Checker.

1/7: Make starting board setup, and give Checker setter methods.

1/9: Make a method which moves a checker from one board square to another. Intialize a game loop (as of yet inescapable), where every turn a player makes a move, and then the board flips for the next player.

1/10: Make a method checkValidMove which checks if a move is valid. Uses helper functions checkNonCapture (implemented) and checkCapture (not yet implemented).

1/17: Complete makeMove so that it can handle both non capture and capture moves.

1/20: Finish methods which check if moves are valid, for both king and normal pieces
