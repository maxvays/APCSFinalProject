# APCSFinalProject
Final Project for APCS Fall 2018 Semester

Terminal based 2 player checkers.



Development Log

1/6: Initialize classes Board and Checker.

1/7: Make starting board setup, and give Checker setter methods.

1/9: Make a method which moves a checker from one board square to another. Intialize a game loop (as of yet inescapable), where every turn a player makes a move, and then the board flips for the next player.
